#  Human Activity Recognition
## Description
Here, we will try to use the data provided by accelerometer and gyroscope of Smartphone to classify the human activity which a Smartphone user is performing.

## Plan of Action
* We will apply classical Machine Learning models on these 561 sized domain expert engineered features.
* data prepocessing 
* Normaliation
* comaprision of models

## Sources 
Data is downloaded from following source:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

## Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.
